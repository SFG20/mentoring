## A Brief Blueprint for Interview Success

- **Before anything else, deeply understand the role and company culture.**
- **Use this understanding to formulate flexible stories that paint a rich picture about who you are and what you’ve accomplished.**
- **Go beyond surface level research, understand the problem the company/product is addressing and their solution.**
- **Differentiate yourself with unique personal projects.**
- **Visualise yourself in the role, become that person.**

The five points above are my guiding principles for anyone preparing for interviews. They served me well, I hope they offer some practical takeaways for your own journey.

## Introduction

Success in interviews often comes down to mindset, preparation, self-awareness, and the ability to tell your story well.

This guide will help you prepare with intention.

It draws from real-life experience, practical mentoring advice, and insights from both sides of the hiring table. It will help you avoid common mistakes and present your best self with confidence.

---

## Understand What the Role Is About

This is a critical first step – it provides direction for everything that follows.

Before you start memorising answers, stop and ask yourself: **What is this company actually looking for?**

Yes, you need to know your tech. But just as important, they want to know if you’re someone that they’d enjoy working with. Would they be happy to sit next to you on a long train ride or chat with you at the pub?

They’re looking for qualities like:
- Curiosity
- Drive
- Openness
- Willingness to take feedback
- Confidence

You don’t need to come across as the finished article. They’re not hiring perfection! They are looking for potential, mindset and culture fit. The qualities above go a long way in showing that.

**How to do this:**
- Carefully study the job description… really pore over it!
- Imagine yourself in the role – what would “above and beyond” look like? What qualities (both behavioural and technical) would that person have? Write them down. Some job descriptions make this obvious, others require reading between the lines.
- For each story or answer you prepare, ask yourself: does this show that I have those qualities?
- Be critical and keep editing your answers until you feel they are impactful and authentic to you.

## Learn Stories, Not Lines

Your end goal is not thirty perfectly rehearsed answers.

Instead, build a set of flexible stories from your experience – projects, challenges, and even failures which can be adapted to a range of questions.

This malleability allows you to respond authentically, showcasing the qualities identified in Step 1.

**Top tip:**
> “Think of it like telling a friend what happens in your favourite film. You remember the story, not the lines. Do the same with your own life and work.”

- Initially write your answers long-form, then boil them down to bullet points.
- Use the bullets as prompts, practise out loud (walking the dog, doing the dishes, etc).
- Once it feels natural, stop. Give yourself time for it all to sink in. Over-practise makes you sound robotic. The goal is to internalise, not memorise.

This approach helps you sound more natural. When you’re not stressing about remembering exact lines, the conversation flows and you genuinely engage in the moment.

---

## Be Self-Aware and Honest

Don’t be afraid to confront awkwardness or areas where you’re still growing.

Interviewers appreciate candidates who are self-aware, know where they want to improve, and can laugh at themselves.

Ask yourself honestly:
> “If I were interviewing me, what would I want to see?”

Remember, around half of the job is working with other people. Your interviewer needs to be able to picture themselves and the wider team working alongside you.

In short…let your personality show!

---

## Research the Company (Deep Dive)

If you want to stand out, go beyond the company’s homepage.

Show that you haven’t just skimmed a “Who We Are” page – demonstrate you’ve engaged with the business and thought critically about what they’re building. After all, this is exactly what you’d be doing in the job.

- Dig into their products, market, and recent launches – check LinkedIn, blog posts, press releases, webinars, anything that gives you more context than the next candidate.
- Try the product yourself, sign up for a free trial, or ask for a demo account if available.
- Understand the problem they’re solving. Look beyond features – try to grasp their philosophy. Are they trying to do good? Disrupt an industry? This helps reveal deeper motivations and the kind of mindset they value in new hires.

Bring real, thoughtful questions to the interview. Ask how or why something is done a certain way. This shows genuine curiosity, not just ticking a box.

The best questions come from deep research, not generic lists.

For example:
> “I noticed you launched Product X in January. I was curious about Feature Y, how did that affect accessibility/authentication/scale?”

This level of detail makes you stand out as a candidate because it shows you have invested time, effort, and curiosity around the product.

---

## Treat it as a Conversation, Not an Interrogation

A great interview feels like a dialogue, not a test.

- If you don’t understand something, ask for clarification.
- If a question sparks curiosity, say so and follow up.
- You don’t need to save all your questions for the end – interviewers genuinely appreciate it when you engage in the moment.

Collaboration is key, especially during technical parts of the interview like a code walkthrough. If you encounter a challenge or an interesting decision point, talk through your thinking out loud.

Don’t be afraid to invite discussion.

If the interviewers are developers, ask how they might approach a similar problem, or what solutions they’ve found work well in practice.

This approach shows that you’re curious, eager to learn, and open to different perspectives.

Viewing the interview as an opportunity to share knowledge rather than just prove yourself is a great way to demonstrate your ability to collaborate and work as part of a team.

---

## Challenge Yourself with Real Projects

Interviewers see countless cookie-cutter projects – stand out by building something unique. Instead of typical apps with familiar tools, choose projects that push you out of your comfort zone.

This gives you richer stories and talking points in the interviews.

If you can, work on something personal and meaningful. Projects that solve a real problem (even a small one) are always more interesting in interviews. Don’t overthink this; if you’re stuck, think about your interests and hobbies!

For example, try using TypeScript instead of JavaScript, or implement a feature you haven’t tried before (authentication, testing, GraphQL, etc).

Personal projects matter because interviewers want to see you succeed and grow. It’s a display of initiative and the ability to take ownership of your learning.

---

## Be Honest About What You Don’t Know

If you’re asked something technical that you don’t know, never blag it. Be upfront but demonstrate your ability to reason through problems based on what you do know.

For example:
> “I haven’t used that library, but based on my experience with X, I’d expect it to work like this…”

Honesty and a willingness to learn always beat bluffing.

Connecting the dots from your existing knowledge shows you think beyond syntax and consider how things are working under the hood.

---

## Go the Extra Mile on Your Work

In your own projects, pay attention to details that show professionalism and care:
- Write a clear, detailed README.
- Add documentation explaining important features.
- Comment on complex code (focus on the *why*, not the *how*).
- Test your code, even if it feels tedious.
- Commit often with descriptive messages (SFG20 uses conventional commits).
- If you’re preparing a code sample, practise talking through it at a high level – what the feature does, how you built it, and why you made those choices. Avoid getting bogged down or sidetracked.

Your projects are a glimpse into the way you work. Treat them as an opportunity to communicate that this is the level of care and attention you’ll bring to the job!

---

## Prepare for the Human Side

The first question is almost always some version of “Tell us about yourself.”

Nail your answer by focusing on your journey, motivations, and what makes you tick as a person and a developer.

You aren’t a mindless coding robot, so don’t be afraid to show enthusiasm, vulnerability, and personality.

**Authenticity resonates.**

It can be difficult viewing your life through this objective lens – if stuck, it can help to talk to friends or mentors and ask,
> “When have you seen me at my best?”  
Use their answers to fill in the gaps and enrich your stories.

Remember, this question isn’t just small talk – it’s their first impression of you and sets the tone for the interview. So really spend some time crafting it thoughtfully.

---

## Visualise the Role (and Act Like You’re Already Doing It)

Imagine yourself as the successful candidate. How would you behave? What habits would you have?

Start acting like that person today.

Whether that’s writing code every day, finishing those tests you’ve been putting off, reviewing your own PRs, or reading documentation before asking for help.

> “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.”  
> — James Clear, *Atomic Habits*

In my own journey, I spent a lot of time in online programming communities. Reading other people’s code, working together to solve problems, and building projects to further my own learning. This helped me get to grips with tools like Git.

It also doesn’t hurt to have some visual representation of your efforts – GitHub commit history, blog posts, whatever feels natural to you and helps you stay consistent.

At the end of the day, the proof is in the pudding, but these little extras only stand to work in your favour.

---

## Follow Up with Care

After the interview, send a thank you email. It’s a small gesture that can leave a strong impression, especially if it is thoughtful and sincere.

- Thank them for their time and mention something specific you enjoyed discussing.
- If relevant, send a code snippet, write-up, or even a test you created in response to a discussion or technical challenge from the interview.
- Use their names and be warm but professional.

Don’t treat this as a tick-box exercise – think of it as the start of a genuine relationship!

---

## Keep Going (Even if You Don’t Get the Job)

It’s no secret that securing a junior position right now is tough.

If you’re unsuccessful, ask for feedback politely and keep the relationship open.

Many good companies offer mentoring, and staying in touch shows resilience and genuine interest. You never know when the door might open again.

Don’t worry if you don’t get a response – it’s not personal (but you will always get a response from SFG20!)

---

## Final Thoughts

You are not expected to be perfect – in some ways, being a developer is a commitment to an entire career of imperfection. Learn to embrace it.

What matters is showing up curious, prepared, and eager to learn.

Be honest about what you don’t know, and confident in who you are and what you bring to the table.

Above all, be the person people want to work with. Tell your story authentically and make sure it aligns with the role and company (remember Step 1!).

There’s no silver bullet; it’s an amalgamation of everything we’ve talked about. Mindset, preparation, and hard work open doors.

Enjoy the process, look to grow as an individual and a developer.

Do that, and you won’t just smash the interview – you’ll build a career full of opportunity.

**Good luck!**
